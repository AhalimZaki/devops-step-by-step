**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

These are some of the questions I received and my answers to them:

**Q1: Will I be qualified to work as a DevOps Engineer after finishing the course?**

A1: Yes. Even though this course is an advanced introduction, you shall be fully capable of applying for a job and working, because my main objective is to properly build and equip you for the actual job market.

**Q2: It is unclear what tools we shall use, whether e they are Azure DevOps or Jenkins? Will we deal with Configuration Management Tools such as Ansible or Teraform? Will we get into subjects like Kubernetes and Docker?**

A2: We shall use Azure DevOps, but no Jenkins. Yes of course we deal with Configuration Management Tools and ours shall be Teraform. As for Docker, we shall definitely get into it, but Kubernetes shall be just theoretical.

Also, there is another extremely important thing: the course objective is not to learn the tools and technology per se, but rather the practices regardless of tools or technology.

However, to learn the practices, we must apply them using tools or technology. You can literally apply what you’ve learned using any other tools or technology not just the ones you’ve learned in class, and this is an additional advantage to the course: Because you have understood the basics, tools and technology have become a means to an end not the end itself.

**Q3: When shall the course start? How shall I pay? Is there a deadline for payment?**

A3: If you are interested in joining, please contact our Financial Manager, Ms. Nadia via WhatsApp on the following [link](https://wa.me/201224073193) or send a text to this no. (00201224073193)

Also, I shall announce the course start date for each cohort on Facebook. So, if you couldn’t enroll in this time, you could try with the next cohort or the one after.

Moreover, the timing shall be updated on the following timetable page:

And it is best you take a look at the reviews left by those who have finished the course. Each and every one of them explains how they benefited from the course and shares their experience that might be very close to your case and thereby answering all your questions.

**Q4: Will the course be useful in Mobile Application? I have taken the Programming Fundamentals Course before with Eng. Moshrif, will it benefit me? How will DevOps benefit me afterwards?**

A4: The Course shall be useful in mobile application development in terms of the product’s life cycle and enhancing its performance. Of course, a programming fundamentals course will make a huge difference especially if you took it with Eng. Moshrif. You can also work in DevOps; it has a huge market all over the world and the demand for it is skyrocketing.



**Q5: I’ve taken an overview of DevOps in a Data Warehousing class in college but in fact, the field itself is a bit unclear. If you could just give us a hint on what it is and the available opportunities for it and will it be a complement to a career in Full stack development?**

A5: It is not a complement to a career in Full Stack development, it is a whole new direction. But, if you are a full stack developer, then it is a good thing because it will help you a lot.

**Q6: Is the course mostly theoretical aimed at understanding the concepts of DevOps?**

A6: The course is very practical, and you’ll have hands-on experience and do everything yourself from A to Z.

**Q7: Will there be an advanced level course immediately after or will there be a long time period between both courses?**

A7: The course shall be very rich. I don’t want to say, “just you handle this one and then worry about the next one later on!”. I just want you to consider this course basic and enough for you to start working. (But you’ll graduate from it like a GP physician or a first-year engineering student) The purpose of this course is for you to be properly built and ready for work and for you to actually know how to do the work itself but it will not make you a specialist or an expert This is something that must come with simultaneous work-study

There are no more courses ready at the moment. Of course, it will take some time for me to prepare any more courses but hopefully, it won’t take long.

**Q8: What are the jobs I can apply for after finishing the course? Because I’m currently working as a system analyst, and I want to make a career shift**

A8: There is more than one professional level for DevOps as well as more than one sub-specialization. But as an entry level you shall be able apply for:

- DevOps Engineer
- Platform Engineer

**Q9: Is there a Certification track with Exams?**

A9: Only an attendance certificate.

**Q10: I’ve locally installed Gitlab as well as Docker Security with Trivy Scanner, and I have some information about DevOps. I’ve tried a few labs of Qwiklabs. But I’m seeing a great experience obviously in the pictures in front of me and I think Model 7 is marvelous but to be clear on what my goals are, I’m doing all this to be a DevSecOps Engineer. So, what I need is Kubernetes as well as Gitlab ci and integration of course. I know you are doing something that suits everyone but, I need your advice.**

A10: This course does not use Gitlab, it uses Azure pipeline instead. For you to be a DevSecOps Engineer, you have to be a good, properly built DevOps engineer first because DevSecOps is an advanced stage of DevOps.  And this course provides an introduction to it but we will not get into details.

Hopefully, the course shall be a quantum leap in your way of thinking and in your work in the field. So, my advice is, forget everything and start with me from scratch, my way, and hopefully you’ll see the result and you’ll even impress yourself with what you’ll be capable of doing.

**Q11 What is the difference between AWS and Azure? And do I have to have a Linux background or at least know something about it because I know nothing about Linux?**

A11: Those are two different companies that provide cloud services, and no you don’t have to at all; you shall learn all that in the course.

**Q12: How important is it to have a credit card in the course? And will money be withdrawn from it? And what if I don’t have a credit card, what shall I do?**

A12: The credit card is for free registration on Microsoft Azure Cloud that will provide you with 3000 Egyptian pounds’ worth of free services. And no money shall be withdrawn from your card, because I shall teach you how to deactivate this feature.

If you don’t have a credit card?

You shall pay me 1500 Egyptian pounds to add you to my premium cloud account.

Make sure the card is a credit card not a debit card as you might not be able to register an account with a debit card.

[A similar question about the same case and the answer to it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/433827/how-to-get-an-azure-account-without-credit-card.html)

**Q13: Will we get into AWS? Is it more desirable in the market?**

A13: No, we shall not get to apply on AWS But, in the end, AWS and Azure are both clous services. The differ only in terms of application not in terms of knowledge or concepts.

The course objective is not to learn tools or technology like AWS or Azure per se, but rather to learn the practices regardless of tools or technology.

However, to understand the practices, we must apply them using any tools or technology, and I shall be using Azure for that.

Nevertheless, you can apply what you shall learn using any other tools or technology and this is an additional advantage to the course as it depends on understanding the basics. And tools and technology have become a means to an end not the end itself, and the market demands both tools almost equally.

**Q14: What if I don’t have the course requirements?**

A14: In that case, try developing a simple software program like a timetable or phonebook using asp.net MVC and reading up a lot on SDLC.

We are going to be writing code and developing a simple software in the course. So, I don’t want your first time seeing or writing code to be in the course; you have to come prepared.

**Q15: Will the course and lectures be recorded in case I couldn’t attend live sessions?**

A15: The lectures shall be recorded and available for free for 4 days you shall be choosing in advance. However, if you want a permanent recording of the lecture, the price of a single lecture will be an additional 450 Egyptian pounds. That is why I am stressing the importance of attendance and not skipping.

**Q16: Are there any more advantages to the course?**

A16: The course shall have technical support and a free subscription to the mentorship program for the first 3 months.

Your mentor shall be able to solve any problems you might face or answer any question you might have. And I shall personally supervise the program to make sure it lives up to the desired standard.

[This link is for more information on the mentorship program](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/blob/main/none-community/mentoring-service.md)

**Q17: How much does the technical support or mentorship program cost?**

A17: First of all, the technical support or mentorship program is an optional choice and not mandatory. The licensing cost for the technical support program is 150 Egyptian pounds per month and technical support itself costs 350 Egyptian pounds per month, but the first 3 months are free.

Also, the top 20 to 50 people in technical support are exempted from the licensing and service fees and this shall be determined later on.

[This link is for more information on the mentorship program](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/blob/main/none-community/mentoring-service.md)

**Q18: Are there any more advantages to the technical support or mentorship program?**

A18: The top 20 to 50 people in technical support, those who are the best and the most diligent students in the course, who provide the most follow-up and the best solutions to technical support problems, shall be nominated to work for companies either locally in Egypt or abroad.

**Q19: Will I be able to work in this field as a fresh graduate with no experience?**

A19: If you are a graduate of this field and were basically clever, committed, and made a lot of effort in the course, hopefully after you finish you shall be able to work better that those who have been in the field for five years, but you have to make a significant amount of effort in the course.

But, if you are not a graduate of the field nor do you have experience in programming, then you definitely need a lot of time to comprehend and apply. Our field is generally that of patience and endurance.

**Q20: Unfortunately, I haven’t successfully found a job yet. What do you suggest I do to make good use of my time till the course starts?**

A20: Watch my DevOps videos; on the Arabic channel, there is a playlist called Step-By-Step DevOps ([ديف اوبس خطوة بخطوة](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL68G6wbDBVghLXN2nDq_J5EGo-qo4QlGJ)), and on my English channel, watch the ([Best Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe14MLC-Nwy5u0w1mD1l2kEiKW16ZlMYG)) playlist. Those videos with make a huge difference.

**Q21: What are the minimum system requirements for the course?**

A21:

- Processor (CPU): Intel Core i5 (sixth generation or newer) or equivalent
- Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Professional x64
- Memory 8/16 GB RAM
- Storage: 500 GB internal storage drive
- Internal or external Webcam (webcam must be opened during all sessions)

**Q22: Is there anything else I need to know about the course?**

A22: You need to know that this is a demanding course and the more you focus and exert yourself, the more you benefit. Also, you must know that there is significant preparation that you must do before every lecture and after every lecture there shall be an assessment that you must take.

**A23: How do I attend the lectures?**

A23: A meeting invitation shall be sent a week before every lecture via Microsoft Teams to the email used in registration. Also, a demo invitation shall be sent before the course starts and every person shall be contacted for confirmation.

**Q24: What is the deadline for course registration?**

A24: The registration deadline for any course is two weeks prior to the course start date except for the first course for which the registration deadline is 28 January.

**Q25: Can I purchase the lecture recordings without registering for the course?**

A25: Yes, that is possible, and in that case the price of the recorded course shall be 10,000 Egyptian pounds.
